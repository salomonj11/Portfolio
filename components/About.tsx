          I&apos;m Jesus. ðŸ¤  I graduated from Loyola University
          Chicago in 2021 with a degree in biology with an emphasis in
          Cellular & Molecular Neuroscience. While at Loyola I learned
          computational methods to understand neural processing in the
          brain. This led me to my discovery of programming and
          eventually falling in love with it. I am well-versed in
          technology and writing code to create systems that are
          reliable and user-friendly. I am a confident communicator,
          strategic thinker, and innovative creator to develop
          software that is customized to meet a company&apos;s
          organizational needs, highlight their core competencies, and
          further their success âœ¨. I am also a quick learner and
          always looking to learn new things. My curriculum vitae (CV)
